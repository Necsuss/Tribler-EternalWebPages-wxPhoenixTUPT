The Eternal Webpages package is a Proof Of Concept package no longer undergoing 
active development. Its main purpose is to download and bundle resources referenced by a webpage
in such a way that they can be fetched offline.
To accomplish this, the webbrowser has 2 modes for viewing websites: one by browsing
the internet and one by downloading P2P cached copies of websites (called internet viewmode and
swarm viewmode respectively). This is shown in \autoref{fig:activitybrowsing}.
The package is referenced from the main Tribler projects web browser for every resource
it ecounters while loading a webpage. This is shown in \autoref{fig:activityseeding}.
The full class diagram of the package is included in \autoref{fig:classdiagrameternalweb}.
